# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- The settings page now walks you through setup instead of presenting every field at once. A three-step checklist at the top shows what is done and what is next, and links to the section that does it.
- **Form pickers instead of pasted IDs.** When the saved key can read forms, the signup, contact and pop-up fields become dropdowns of your own forms, filtered by kind. A workspace with exactly one matching form has it preselected. Keys that cannot read forms, or an unreachable API, fall back to the original ID field, so nothing that worked before stops working.
- **Connect is its own first section**, ahead of Forms; the API key used to sit inside Site email, which implied it was only for email.
- The connection state is shown and distinguishes the three cases that need different fixes: key rejected, key valid but missing the Forms (read) permission, and API unreachable. "Check again" re-tests without saving.
- Pop-up and site-email detail fields are hidden while those features are off.
- One dismissible notice after activation, which removes itself once connected. No redirect on activation.

## 1.1.0

- Site email: `pre_wp_mail` relays every `wp_mail()` message to `POST /api/v1/transactional` (HTML or plain text, cc/bcc, reply-to, X-* headers, From overrides). Settings → SendBeam → Site email: switch, API key (or `SENDBEAM_API_KEY` in wp-config.php), From name/address, fallback to the server mailer, "Send a test email", last 20 results. Attachments stay with the server mailer.
